			<h2>About Us</h2>
			<h3>About Natalie<h3>
			<p>One who focuses on the knitty-gritty details, Natalie’s passion as a real estate consultant was first ignited when she realized that she could maximise her skills by helping her clients analyze and restructure their property portfolios. In reviewing those numbers, she is able to gather more insight as to when and what their next move should be. Natalie is constantly on the go by committing herself to picking up a thing or two from every client she serves and reflecting on how she can work to serve her clients better.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>About Ethan<h3>
			<p>Ethan’s interest to pursue a career as a real estate consultant was formed when he was a Real Estate Business student. Having learnt that there are many growing blind spots in the real estate industry, he feels that it is extremely important to be there for his clients to ensure that they do not misjudge their next moves in their asset progression journey. With hours of property research and realignment, Ethan aspires that each and every client’s needs are looked out for and at the end of the day, expectations surpassed.</p>
			<br>
			<h2>Why was NE Properties formed?</h2>
			<p>Natalie and Ethan always believe in providing the best for their clients in terms of property analysis and advice therefore NE Properties was forged under the basis of perspective. Why perspective? In the current property market, they understand that their clients and potential clients are constantly looking towards different viewpoints. In the process of working together, Natalie and Ethan will be able to provide their clients with various perspectives of their current stage and craft solutions on what they should do next.
